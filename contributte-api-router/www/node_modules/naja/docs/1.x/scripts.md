# Scripts in snippets

`ScriptLoader` executes scripts that are dynamically added to the page via snippets. If you have scripts in your
snippets, be aware that they might be executed multiple times as the user navigates the site. In many cases, you can
also implement the desired behavior using [extensions](extensions-custom.md).
